Hackaton task - build an app that will focus on culture and business.

Imagine that You have 40 PLN/EUR in Your pocket.
You have some free time and You want to hang out somewhere, alone, with friends or Your better half :)

Now this app comes in handy

It locates Your position, you provide how much money can You spend on attractions
Than You just have to point out what type of place or entertainment would You like to experience/visit

At first You have 6 choices : Museum, Theatre, Cinema, Bar/Pub, Event, Cafe, Food

Now you can provide additional options for example - pub with a garden or restaurant with live music.

IF You are registered user and have some places visited already you can check an option to find a place you were not before, nice thing to explore new places, isnt it?

Okay now the magic begins, after You click the search button, a wild list of places appears.

You can filter them by: 
* minimal price - lets say minimal price for a menu
* distance 
* exclusiveness (maybe if you want to go eat some food with Your girlfriend it will be better to focus on restaurants and not a food track :) ) PS We love food tracks it is just an example
* opinions/rating - given by other users


After You choose something the app will guide you there, if a place is an partner with our app, maybe You can get some discount :)
